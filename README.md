##Description:

This game is my 3rd project for the Udaicty Front-End Web Development nanodgree. The goal is to create a classic arcage frogger game using the newly acquired skills in Object Oriented JS and HTML5 Canvas. Images and a game loop engine are provided. The rest should be built in app.js file!

###How to score:
 - Use arrow keys to move up, down, left, right.
 - Try to avoid bugs.
 - bulb Avoid the bugs, collect the stars and cross the road!
 - If you use alll the lives, game is lost!
 - Try to reach door in the water to win the game 

###How to run the Game:
 - Open the index.html file on the browser.

###Explanation of project structure:

  - index.html is pretty much empty! it only contains the canvas element and instructions to play the game
  - js/ArcadeGame.js contains the game characters and do the event handling
  - js/ArcadeGameEngine.js have the actual game loop which sets the canvas and redraw the game each time based on the game characters data. It is doing a little more then that so dig through the code to fully understanding it. @$#%^$& yuck! :[
  - js/ArcadeGameResources.js is just a resource caching utility

###Technologies Used
 - HTML Canvas
 - Javascript
